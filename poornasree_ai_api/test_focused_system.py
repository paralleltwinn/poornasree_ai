        MACHINE STARTUP PROCEDURE:
        1. Check all safety guards are in place
        2. Verify emergency stop is accessible
        3. Turn on main power switch
        4. Initialize the control system
        5. Run diagnostic checks
        6. Calibrate spindle if needed
        
        SPINDLE DEFINITION:
        The spindle is the rotating shaft that holds and drives the cutting tool.
        It provides the rotational motion needed for machining operations.
        
        MOTOR TROUBLESHOOTING:
        - Check power connections
        - Verify motor overload protection
        - Test motor windings
        - Check for mechanical binding
        
        SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
        - Always wear safety glasses
        - Keep hands away from moving parts
        - Use proper lockout/tagout procedures
        - Never bypass safety interlocks
        
        MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE:
        - Daily: Check fluid levels, clean machine
        - Weekly: Lubricate moving parts
        - Monthly: Inspect belts and couplings
        - Quarterly: Full system inspection
